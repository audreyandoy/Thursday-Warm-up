# VARIABLES - stores a piece of data

a = 2 #integer 
b = "2" #string

print(a+a)
print(b+b)

# What are the 2 characteristics of data?  VALUE and DATA TYPE

# LOOP - repeats code for a given amount of times or until a condition is met. 

# For loop 
for i in range(5):
  print("It's almost friday", i)

# while
# smelly = True
# while smelly == True:
#   print("i smell")
#   smelly = False 
counter = 0 
while counter < 5:
  print(counter)
  counter += 1

# Conditionals - IF/ELSE
if counter == 0:
  print("equals 0")
elif counter > 5:
  print("greater than 5")
else:
  print("less than 5")

#1. Give me an example of a string variable and an integer variable
num = 0
name = "Audrey"
#2. Create your OWN for loop
for i in range(3):
  print("I'm hungry")
#3. Create your OWN while loop
status = "hungry"
while status == "hungry":
  print("eat eat eat")
  status = "full"
  
#4. In a comment, provide an example of when to use:
     # a) a variable
     # b) a loop
     # c) a conditionals
#5. Provide any questions that you currently have or provide a concept you're confused about.
